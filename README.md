# Human Eval Bar
A deep learning model that takes in features of a position (time remaining, rating, characteristics of pieces) and outputs the win/loss/draw probabilities for each player. These probabilities are intended to create a human evaluation of the position, containing context such as difficulty of position given the time remaining to output a more practical evaluation than current Stockfish. 

# Dataset 
All data is available in /data. Scripts used to collect the data are in /data/scripts. Normalized tabular dataset is in /data/normalized, which includes starting time, time remaining, FEN of current position, player ratings, result of game (outcome).

# Models
Work in progress!
